#+TITLE: Gnome

Activating my keyboard preferences works in Gnome (but not in KDE :( )
#+begin_src sh
~/dotfiles/keyboard.sh
#+end_src

I usually don't like animations in the desktop environment. Call it an
occupational hazard for using tiling window managers for too long.
#+begin_src sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface.enable-animations "false"
#+end_src

Here is a command for grepping through all keybindings that use super. It is
very useful for when trying to find conflicting keybindings.
#+begin_src sh
gsettings list-recursively | grep -F "<Super>"
#+end_src

Use super+<num> to Switch between workspaces like xmonad :)
#+begin_src sh
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter dynamic-workspaces false
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences num-workspaces 10
